# Third Conditional

### What is the Third Conditional?
The **Third Conditional** is used to talk about hypothetical situations in the past that did not happen. It describes how things could have been different if certain conditions had been met.

### Structure
**If + past perfect**, **would have + past participle**

- **If clause**: Describes the condition (uses **past perfect**).
- **Main clause**: Describes the result (uses **would have + past participle**).

### Example Sentences
1. **If** I **had known** about the party, I **would have gone**.
2. **If** she **had studied** harder, she **would have passed** the exam.
3. **If** they **had left** earlier, they **would have arrived** on time.

### Key Points
- The **if clause** can come first or second:
  - **If** he **had asked** me, I **would have helped** him.
  - I **would have helped** him **if** he **had asked** me.

- You can use other modal verbs to express different meanings:
  - **Could have**: If I **had tried** harder, I **could have succeeded**.
  - **Might have**: If it **had rained**, we **might have stayed** indoors.

### Negative Sentences in the Third Conditional
To form negative sentences, add **not** after **would have** in the main clause or after the auxiliary verb **had** in the **if clause**.

- **If** I **had not gone** to the concert, I **would not have met** her.
- **If** she **hadnâ€™t forgotten** her keys, we **would have been** on time.

### Example Scenarios
- **If** I **had taken** that job, I **would have moved** to New York.
- **If** they **had listened** to my advice, they **would have avoided** the problem.
- **If** we **had known** about the traffic, we **would have left** earlier.
