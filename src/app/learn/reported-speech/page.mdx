# Reported Speech

### What is Reported Speech?

Reported speech (or indirect speech) is when you tell someone what another person said, without quoting them directly. The structure and tenses usually change when transforming direct speech into reported speech.

### Structure

- **Direct speech**: "I am going to the store," she said.
- **Reported speech**: She said **that** she **was going** to the store.

The word "that" is often optional.

### Tense Changes

When converting to reported speech, the tense usually shifts **back in time**.

  - **Reported**: He told me **not to be late**.
