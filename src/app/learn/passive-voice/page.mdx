# Passive Voice

### What is Passive Voice?

In passive voice, the **object** of an action becomes the **subject** of the sentence. The focus is on the action or what is being done, rather than who is doing it.

### Structure

**Subject + form of "to be" + past participle (+ by + agent)**

- **Subject**: The thing receiving the action
- **Form of "to be"**: am/is/are/was/were/been/being
- **Past participle**: The verb in past form (e.g., done, written, made)
- **By + agent**: Who or what does the action (optional)

### Examples

1. **Active**: The chef cooks the meal.
   - **Passive**: The meal is cooked **by the chef**.

2. **Active**: They will deliver the package tomorrow.
   - **Passive**: The package will be delivered **tomorrow**.

3. **Active**: She wrote the report.
   - **Passive**: The report was written **by her**.

### Key Points

- **Use passive** when the agent (doer) is unknown, unimportant, or obvious.
- **Passive tenses** follow the same tense rules as active voice:
  - **Present**: is/are + past participle → The house **is cleaned**.
  - **Past**: was/were + past participle → The project **was finished**.
  - **Future**: will be + past participle → The work **will be done**.
