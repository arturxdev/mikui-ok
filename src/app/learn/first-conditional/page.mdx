# First Conditional

### What is the First Conditional?

The **First Conditional** is used to talk about real and possible situations in the future. It describes things that are likely to happen if a certain condition is met.

### Structure

**If + present simple**, **will + base verb**

- **If clause**: Describes the condition (uses **present simple**).
- **Main clause**: Describes the result (uses **will + base verb**).

### Example Sentences

1. **If** it **rains**, I **will stay** home.
2. **If** she **studies**, she **will pass** the exam.
3. **If** they **arrive** early, we **will go** out for dinner.

### Key Points

- The **if clause** can come first or second:
  - **If** he **calls**, I **will answer**.
  - I **will answer** **if** he **calls**.

- You can use other modal verbs to express different meanings:
  - **May**: If it **gets** sunny, we **may go** to the park.
  - **Might**: If I **finish** early, I **might join** you.

### Negative Sentences in the First Conditional

To form negative sentences, add **not** after **will** in the main clause or use the negative form of the present simple in the **if clause**.

- **If** it **does not rain**, we **will go** for a walk.
- **If** she **doesn't study**, she **will not pass** the test.

### Example Scenarios

- **If** I **see** him, I **will tell** him the news.
- **If** they **finish** the project on time, they **will celebrate**.
- **If** we **get** tickets, we **will enjoy** the concert.
