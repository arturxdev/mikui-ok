# Second Conditional

### What is the Second Conditional?
The **Second Conditional** is used to talk about hypothetical or unreal situations in the present or future. It describes situations that are unlikely to happen.

### Structure
**If + past simple**, **would + base verb**

- **If clause**: Describes the condition (uses **past simple**).
- **Main clause**: Describes the result (uses **would + base verb**).

### Example Sentences
1. **If** I **won** the lottery, I **would travel** the world.
2. **If** she **had** a million dollars, she **would buy** a mansion.
3. **If** they **were** here, we **would start** the meeting.

**Note**: Use **were** for all subjects in the **if clause** (e.g., I, you, he, she, it, we, they).

### Key Points
- The **if clause** can come first or second:
  - **If** he **studied** harder, he **would pass** the exam.
  - He **would pass** the exam **if** he **studied** harder.

- You can use other modal verbs to express different meanings:
  - **Could**: If I **had** more time, I **could** learn Spanish.
  - **Might**: If it **were** sunny, we **might** go to the beach.

### Negative Sentences in the Second Conditional
To form negative sentences, add **not** after **would** in the main clause or after the verb in the **if clause**.

- **If** I **didnâ€™t have** to work, I **would not go** to the party.
- **If** she **were not** afraid, she **would try** it.

### Example Scenarios
- **If** I **were** you, I **would take** that job.
- **If** they **went** out tonight, they **would see** their friends.
- **If** we **had** a bigger house, we **would invite** everyone over.
