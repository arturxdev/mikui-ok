# Relative Clauses

### What are Relative Clauses?

Used to add information about a noun. They start with **who, which, that, whose, where, when**.

### Types of Relative Clauses

#### Defining Clauses

Give essential information. No commas.  

- **Example**: The man **who** is talking is my teacher.

#### Non-defining Clauses

Give extra information. Use commas.  

- **Example**: My friend, **who** lives in London, is visiting.
